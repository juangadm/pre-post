## What it does

pre-post reads your git diff, detects which routes changed, and screenshots them — production vs your new version. Desktop and mobile, at 2x retina quality. It then adds a before/after comparison table directly to your pull request.

## How it works

1. Make your UI changes
2. Say `/pre-post` in Claude Code
3. pre-post reads your git diff and detects which pages changed
4. It screenshots each route — production vs your new version
5. You review the screenshots
6. pre-post adds a pre/post table to your PR
